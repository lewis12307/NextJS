               <h2>Final Project Topic</h2>
               <p>For our final project, my partner and I would like to create a web application that allows the user to keep track of their growth and progress as they start a new hobby. To do this, we will use the Django Python web framework. We will leverage many of Django's built-in features, including its user authentication system and its admin interface.</p>
